# Web-Scraping-World-Population-Data-from-Wikipedia
A Python project for web scraping world population data from Wikipedia, using BeautifulSoup and pandas to extract, process, and analyze the data.


This repository contains a Python-based project that demonstrates how to web scrape world population data from Wikipedia. The project uses popular Python libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` to extract, process, and analyze the data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Scrape world population data from a Wikipedia page.
- Clean and structure the scraped data using `pandas`.


## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Utilizes `requests` to fetch the Wikipedia page and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content.
- **Data Processing:** Leverages `pandas` for data cleaning and transformation, turning raw HTML tables into structured DataFrames.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup4`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib` (optional, for visualizations)
